## <!-- [0.2.1-beta] - -->UNPUBLISHED

<!-- <small>[Compare to previous release][comp:0.2.1-beta]</small> -->

### Package: TopMarksDevelopment.ExpressionBuilder(* All)

#### Fixed

-   Fixed the paths for the icons and the links to GitHub source code

#### Changed

-   Updated the copyright year for NuGet packages and `License.md`

### Package: TopMarksDevelopment.ExpressionBuilder.Operations.* (All Operations)

#### Changed

-   Moved all extension methods from the `TopMarksDevelopment.ExpressionBuilder.Api` namespace to `TopMarksDevelopment.ExpressionBuilder`, for easier access _(not technically "breaking" as the main package is always required to operate)_

## [0.2.0-beta] - 2024-02-28

<small>[Compare to previous release][comp:0.2.0-beta]</small>

### Package: TopMarksDevelopment.ExpressionBuilder.Api

#### Breaking Changes

-   Moved the `Connector` and `Matches` enumerators from `TopMarksDevelopment.ExpressionBuilder.Api` to `TopMarksDevelopment.ExpressionBuilder`, for easier access

### Package: TopMarksDevelopment.ExpressionBuilder

#### Fixes

-   Removed duplicated methods from `TopMarksDevelopment.ExpressionBuilder`, as they were already in the `TopMarksDevelopment.ExpressionBuilder.Api` namespace. This prevented you from using an `Add` extension method if you `use` both namespaces

### General changes (non-package related)

#### Changes

-   Added GitHub `FUNDING.yml` to hopefully get some support/funding üòú
-   (Non-user facing) Updated the GitHub workflows to use the current versions of `checkout` and `setup-dotnet`
